# Polkadot

Polkadot is a blockchain protocol that connects specific blockchains into one single multinetwork provides a high level of interoperability and security.

Gear technology was developed as one of the key components of the Polkadot ecosystem and provides a powerful tool for writing smart contracts at a high level. Why Polkadot? As the Layer 1 Polkadot is a universal core that provides cross-chain interaction between specific blockchains. It is a key technology for implementing our vision of the Internet of the future. And we have a lot in common!

The majority of developers and inspirers of Gear were directly involved in the creation of Polkadot and Substrate technologies. Gear was developed taking into account the features of the architecture and design of its older brother. We rely on the high security and flexibility of our product, just like Polkadot.
